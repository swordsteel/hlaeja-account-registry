In twilight's hush, where mythic tales unfold, A ledger of legends, the bravest to behold. Each hero's name, etched in the annals of time, Their feats of strength, magic, and cunning, forever to shine. From dark forests to ancient ruins, guilds unite, Their banners waving, in the face of endless night. The Guild Codex, a sacred text of old, A testament to heroes, where courage never grows cold.
